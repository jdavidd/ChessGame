# ChessGame - JAVA SOCKETS

This application in university project, for the course "Metode de dezvoltare Software", Software Methods for applications development.It's was a team project so I worked with three other colleagues.  
We had to develop a multiplayer chess game based on client-server arhitecture as a desktop application.  
The project had minimum requirements like a login/register system, a global chat for the users, private/public rooms.
